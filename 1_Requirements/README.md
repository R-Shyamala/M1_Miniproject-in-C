# Requirements
# Introduction
* Library management is a project that organises and maintains electronic book material based on the demands of students. Both students and library managers benefit from the system, which allows them to keep track of all of the books available in the library at all times. It allows both the administrator and the student to look for the book they want.
* The Library Management System project is Library Management software that is used to monitor and control transactions in a library. The "Library Management System" project is written in C and focuses on fundamental library activities such as adding new books, updating new information, searching for books and members, and returning books.
* This project provides us with all of the necessary information on the library. We can create new book records and retrieve information about books that are currently available in the library. We may issue books to students and keep track of their progress, as well as check how many books have been distributed and how much stock is available in the library. We can keep the late fee for students who return provided books after the due date with this initiative.
# Objectives
* To create a system that can receive input and generate output automatically in a simple and quick manner.

# SWOT Analysis
# Strength
* Simple to Use.
* Highly Secure, Scalable & Reliable.
* Engages People to Use Library.
* Mobile access.
# Weakness
* Costly and Expensive.
* Complicate to Operate.
* Online Systems require high-speed internet connectivity.
# Opportunities
* The library management system oozes into previously new territory, such as reading list repositories, learning systems, and research data management. 
* In addition, the future of library systems is likely to have a combination of open and closed systems, as well as local and shared services. 
* Libraries will be necessary to navigate these multiple locations and ecosystems as a rising number of closed platforms (such as Facebook) and proprietary ecosystems (such as Apple) emerge.
# Threats
* Libraries now retrieve the information from databases to aid in inventory management and other tasks, but some libraries do not follow proper data encryption procedures. 
* This can result in data loss and, in some cases, data that is easily accessible to thieves.
