# Requirements
## Introduction
* Library management is a project that organises and maintains electronic book material based on the demands of students. Both students and library managers benefit from the system, which allows them to keep track of all of the books available in the library at all times. It allows both the administrator and the student to look for the book they want.
* The Library Management System project is Library Management software that is used to monitor and control transactions in a library. The "Library Management System" project is written in C and focuses on fundamental library activities such as adding new books, updating new information, searching for books and members, and returning books.
* The "LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM" project provides us with all of the information we need about the library. We can create new book records and retrieve information about books that are currently available in the library. We may issue books to students and keep track of their progress, as well as check how many books have been distributed and how much stock is available in the library. We can keep the late fee for students who return provided books after the due date with this initiative.
